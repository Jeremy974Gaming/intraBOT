# intraBOT - Your link to the NYLX Network !
Intranet bot of the NYLX Network

This project consists of developing a bot linking the intranet with Discord and helping get more out of the servers across the NYLX Network.

This project is developed in Python and mostly developed by one person.

You may fork and star this project, its fork must not contain any intranet-related features, if you've got your own, then make your own featureset.

For any technical support which there isn't any, as this project and associated files are provided on an "AS-IS" basis thus without guarantees,
you may create a pull request so the most up-to-date code gets published.

You also need to take extreme precautions to any dependencies required therein:

-> discord.py
-> dotenv
-> discord.ext
-> ffmpeg
-> pyparsing
-> Python extension for VSCode [VSCode Users]

Without such dependencies, the bot does not run
