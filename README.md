# intraBOT
Intranet bot of the NYLX Network

This project consists of developing a bot linking the intranet with Discord and helping get more out of the servers across the NYLX Network.

This project is developed in Python and mostly developed by one person.

You may fork and star this project, its fork must not contain any intranet-related features, if you've got your own, then make your own featureset.
